# Translation Rules

- **ALWAYS** add translations for any new text strings in both `src/i18n/en.json` and `src/i18n/de.json`
- When adding new UI components or pages, check if translations are needed
- Translation keys should be descriptive and follow the existing naming convention (e.g., `component.action`, `page.title`)
- Sort translation keys alphabetically within each file
- Use `FormattedMessage` component for all user-facing text
- Never hardcode strings in components - always use translation keys
- When adding new features, add corresponding translation keys immediately
